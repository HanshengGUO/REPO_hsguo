# Summer Research Weekly Report

## Name & SID: YI Jian 1155157207 
## Week: 

## Overview: 

1. Worked with Juluan, integrated time featrues into data handler.
2. Correspongdingly implemented  train and valid session in exp_basic. Test part and further fit is to be implemented.

## Paper Reading: (if applicatable)

Browsed some courses about deep learning. Read much study notes about MTGNN
## Coding: (if applicatable)

Which part you working on (model name, dataset name)

- Coding progress: Key problem is data handler. Origin MTGNN's input is a 4 D tensor instead of 3 D. So we(mainly Juluan) added time featrures in data handler from MTGNN and it works.


- Problems: Coundn't read string


- Requests: MTGNN has a "generate training data" part and hard to fit in current frame.

## Summary and TODO Next Week

Maybe further improve code readability
